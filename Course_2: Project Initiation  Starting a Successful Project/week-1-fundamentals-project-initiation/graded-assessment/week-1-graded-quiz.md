You expect that a project will bring in $12,000 USD in revenue per year. You estimate it will cost $5,000 up front. You also estimate costs of $50 per month for the first 12 months, which equals $600 per year. Using the formula (G-C) ÷ C = ROI, how would you calculate the project’s return on investment (ROI) after the first 12 months?

- 12,000 - 5,000) ÷ 5,000 = 140%


- (12,000 - 5,600) ÷ 5,000 = 128%


- (5,600 - 5,000) ÷ 12,000 = 5%


- **(12,000 - 5,600) ÷ 5,600 = 114%**
