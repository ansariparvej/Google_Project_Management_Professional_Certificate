## Practice Quiz: Time estimation

<br>

### Question 1

What are the benefits of providing accurate time estimates for individual tasks? Select all that apply.

+ [ ] They enable you to avoid purchasing expensive project management software.

+ [x] They help you predict if a milestone may go over a deadline.

> If a milestone is likely to go over an important deadline, you can quickly make adjustments to the size of the tasks or team members' workloads to fit within a required deadline. Accurate estimates also help to establish a better sense of the project timeline and track task progress.

+ [x] They help you accurately track task progress.

> Knowing tasks’ time estimates allows you to better understand how far along a team is with a particular phase of a project. Accurate estimates also help to establish a better sense of the project timeline and clarify if a milestone may go over deadline.

+ [x] They establish a better sense of the overall project timeline.

> By adding up each task’s duration, you get an informed idea of when you and your team will complete the project. Accurate estimates also clarify if a milestone may go over deadline and help to track task progress.

### Question  2

As a project manager, you try to get an accurate time estimate for a task by communicating with an expert. After considering their time estimate, you are unsure if it includes all steps of a task, so you ask them to explain each step in detail. 

What strategy for getting an accurate time estimate did you choose?

- **Check the expert's understanding of the task.**

> You won’t include every detailed step in the project plan, but it may help the expert come to a time estimate by thoroughly explaining each step in a task.


- Check the expert’s estimates against the actual time spent on similar tasks in previous work.


- Ask the expert how likely they think it is that an assumption might not work out and how it would affect their estimate.


- Assess the expert’s confidence level in their estimate.

### Question 3

As a project manager, you try to get an accurate time estimate for a task by communicating with an expert. After receiving their time estimate, you ask questions like, “What equipment do you suppose you’ll have?” and “How many people do you expect to work on the task?” 

What strategy for getting an accurate time estimate did you choose?

- **Discuss the assumptions the expert may be making when they give an estimate.**


- Assess the expert’s confidence level in their estimate.


- Check the expert’s estimates against the actual time spent on similar tasks in previous work.


- Ask the expert how likely it is that assumptions they have might not work out and how it would affect their estimate.

### Question 4

As a project manager, you try to get an accurate time estimate for a task by communicating with an expert. You ask them to think back to a task that resembles the one for this project and describe what was the same, what was different, and if thinking about this previous task changes their estimate. 

What strategy for getting an accurate time estimate did you choose?

- **Check the expert’s estimates against the actual time spent on similar tasks.**

> You can estimate task time by reviewing the time it took an expert to complete a similar task on a previous project. 


- Ask the expert how likely they think it is that their assumptions might not work out and how it would affect their estimate.


- Check their understanding of the task.


- Discuss the assumptions the expert may be making when they give an estimate.

### Question 5

What type of time estimate considers how long it takes to complete a task, plus the time it takes to test the product?

- Conservative estimate


- Timeline estimate


- Effort estimate


- **Total duration estimate**

> There are two types of time estimates: effort estimates and total duration estimates. The main difference between effort estimate and total duration estimate is adding time for factors such as prep, approvals, and testing.
