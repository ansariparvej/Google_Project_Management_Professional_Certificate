+ [x] Discretionary dependency

> A discretionary dependency is defined by the project team. In this scenario, the project team decides to get the client to approve their new recipe before they invest time, effort, and work on development. This scenario also illustrates an external dependency, which relies on outside factors.

+ [ ] Mandatory dependency

+ [x] External dependency

> An external dependency relies on outside factors like another company, project, or regulatory agency. This scenario also illustrates a discretionary dependency, which is defined by the team.

+ [ ] Group dependencies by cost

+ [x] Proper identification 

> Project managers should brainstorm dependencies with their teams and group them accordingly. They should also record dependencies, practice continuous monitoring and control, and communicate efficiently.
