## Practice Quiz: Retrospectives

<br>

### Question 1

A project manager sends out an anonymous team survey for feedback after a customer reports they’re not happy with a product feature. Then, the project manager calls a team meeting to discuss the feedback in the survey. During the meeting, the project manager asks the team to use “we” language instead of “you” language. At the end of the meeting, the team discusses what lessons the team will carry into future work.
