## Practice Quiz:  Understanding organizational structure

<br>

### Question 1

Which of the following scenarios best describes a Classic structure?

- Imagine you work at a small marketing agency, and you have just begun a new project. All of the company’s graphic designers work in the Art department and report to the Art Director. However, two of those graphic designers have been assigned to your project, so they will also report to you while working on the project.


- **Imagine you are managing an important project at a company that requires all orders to go through its shipping department. However, your project is on a tight schedule, and the shipping department has a backlog of orders. You decide to meet with your direct manager to ask for approval to place the order through a third-party vendor. Ultimately, your direct manager has to meet with a vice president to get final approval.**
> In a Classic organization, project managers are part of a top-down hierarchy and should communicate with their direct managers frequently to keep them informed.

- Imagine you work alongside a small group of project managers. One of your current projects shares team members with another, ongoing project. To make sure you hit your next milestone, you want your team members to work only on your project for the next two weeks. You decide to meet with your team to discuss your proposal.

### Question 2


Why is it important for a project manager in a Matrix organization to clearly define roles and responsibilities? Select all that apply.

+ [x] Because project managers can have the same level of authority as functional managers 

> While it’s always important to define roles and responsibilities clearly, the more complex reporting structure of a Matrix organization makes this task especially crucial. Functional areas tend to cross paths more frequently, and depending on the nature of the work, the responsible manager for each area has the most authority.

+ [x] Because employees may report to more than one person and have multiple responsibilities across teams

> In both Classic and Matrix organizations, project managers must clearly define roles and responsibilities in order to work effectively. However, within most Matrix organizations, some project managers may have the same level of authority as the functional managers and operate more directly.

+ [ ] Because project managers need to identify their single manager or director


+ [ ] Because project managers must get approval from their direct superiors for any decisions they make about day-to-day project activities

### Question 3

What are some ways that organizational structure can impact the role of a project manager? Select all that apply.

+ [x] Their access to resources

> Organizational structure may affect how the project manager accesses the people, equipment, and budget that they need. A project manager working in a Classic structure may depend on the functional managers in their organization to approve resources. In a Matrix structure, a project manager may need to share project resources and negotiate priorities with other groups. 

+ [ ] Their possibility of career growth

+ [x] Their approach to getting approvals

> Since Classic structures have a clear chain of command and Matrix structures do not, the process for getting approvals in these organizational structures differs. A project manager in a Classic structure may have to get approval from the appropriate managers, directors, and department heads in order to complete certain tasks. A project manager in a Matrix organization, on the other hand, may have more autonomy to make decisions for the project as needed.

+ [x] Their level of authority

> A project manager’s level of authority and responsibility will vary in different organizational structures. In a Classic structure, a project manager might have less authority and a tighter scope. In a Matrix structure, a project manager will have to cooperate with other leaders in their organization and may have less direct authority over their team members.

### Question 4

What are some key functions of a Project Management Office (PMO)? Select all that apply.

+ [x] Strategic planning and governance

> PMOs define project criteria, select projects according to the organization’s business goals, and provide a business case for those projects to management.

+ [x] Creating project documentation, archives, and tools

> PMOs invest in and provide templates, tools, and software to help manage projects and help maintain their organization’s project history. 

+ [ ] Managing the organization's income and expenses
