### Question 2

What are the benefits of timeboxes? Select all that apply.

+ [x] They help the team develop a predictable rhythm to their work.

> By setting a timboxed meeting and work schedule, teammates can more accurately predict how much time they have for tasks during a Sprint. In addition, timeboxes provide a window of focus for the team and help the team address the most urgent tasks.

+ [ ] They enable the team to visually understand the work.

+ [x] They provide a window of focus to improve productivity.

> With a set amount of time to complete a task, such as two weeks, the team only has to focus on their work during that limited window. In addition, timeboxes help to regularly pace the team’s work and allow the team to focus on urgent tasks.

### Question 4

Which of the following factors should you consider when setting the length of a Sprint’s timebox? Select all that apply.

+ [ ] The likelihood that the project will go over budget

+ [x] How much focused time the solution Developers need to build a Backlog item

> You should consider how much focused time your solution Developers need to build a Backlog item. With this information, you can set a timebox that allows the team to create something valuable but does not create undue time pressure.

+ [x] How much overhead—such as testing and review—goes into the delivery of the product

> You should consider how much overhead goes into product delivery. For instance, a product that requires a major review with many stakeholders may require a longer timebox.

+ [x] The expected frequency of changes

> You should consider what you expect the frequency of changes to be. This might include changing requirements or new requests—both of which can impact the timebox. A project with less consistent needs typically benefits from a longer Sprint.
