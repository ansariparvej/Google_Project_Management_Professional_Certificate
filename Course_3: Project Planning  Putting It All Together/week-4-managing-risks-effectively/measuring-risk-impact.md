## Practice Quiz: Measuring risk impact

<br>

### Question 1

Which type of risk involves the possibility that a project will not produce the results outlined in the project goals?

- Environmental risk


- Budget risk


- Time risk


- **Scope risk**

> This type of risk involves the possibility that a project won't meet your project goals and could result in the deliverables of your project not being acceptable to your stakeholders or customers.

### Question 2

Imagine you’re a project manager overseeing the development and launch of a new app. Which of the following problems could be a single point of failure risk in the app’s development?

- **Failing to back up key project documentation, which may result in a complete loss of essential data.**

> If the documents become corrupted and the data gets lost, the project can’t move forward until the team rebuilds them. That makes this a single point of failure risk, which has the potential to be catastrophic and halt work across the project. 


- Completing a project milestone behind schedule, which may delay the project timeline.


- Lack of communication between the designers and the project lead, which may lead to tension among team members.


- Receiving negative feedback from user testing, which may lead to more work for the developers.

### Question 3

Continuing with the app-development project scenario from the previous question, which three of the following task relationships demonstrate an _internal_ dependency?

+ [ ] Clients must sign off on the design before the official launch.


+ [ ] Partner agencies must deliver image assets before the app is complete.


+ [x] Researchers must conduct usability tests before the team can improve the design.

> Your team is responsible for usability testing, making this an internal dependency.

+ [x] Designers must complete wireframes before they begin prototyping. 

> Your team is responsible for the app’s design, making this an internal dependency.

+ [x] Developers must fix bugs before the Quality Assurance team begins testing.

### Question 4

Continuing with the app-development project scenario from the previous question, you need to secure funding to develop the app. You want to write a grant proposal to an investment firm. Which of the following is an _external_ dependency for this task?

- **Get feedback from the investment firm about the types of projects they are interested in funding.**

> Your team can’t control what interests the investment firm, making this an external dependency for the grant-writing task.


- Identify team members to write the sections of the proposal that align with their expertise.


- Outline your project milestones in the proposal.


- Appoint a team member to assemble the proposal.
