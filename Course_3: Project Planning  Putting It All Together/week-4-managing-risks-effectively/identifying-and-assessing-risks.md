## Practice Quiz: Identifying and assessing risks

<br>

### Question 1

Imagine that youâ€™re overseeing a project to construct a new office building for your company, and you need to determine your task dependencies. Which of the following tasks should come first?

- Begin construction on the new building.


- **Get stakeholder input to determine project goals.**

> Connecting with stakeholders is a critical first step in any new project. Following that, you can set the project budget, identify the construction site, and begin construction on the new building. 


- Set the project budget.


- Identify the construction site.

<br>

### Question 2

Continuing with the construction project scenario from the previous question, which of the following tasks should come last in the project? 

- **Move equipment to the new office.**

> Moving equipment into the new office comes after planning for risk, hiring an architect, and ordering materials.


- Order the building materials.


- Hire an architect. 


- Plan for risk.

<br>

### Question 3

Continuing with the construction project scenario from the previous question, imagine that you underestimated the amount of a particular material needed to complete the new building. You purchase more of the material at full cost, since you no longer qualify for the bulk, discounted rate. What risk does this scenario demonstrate?

- **Budget risk**

> Unexpected costs due to poor planning can pose a risk to the project budget.


- Time risk


- Legal risk


- Environmental risk

### Question 4

Continuing with the construction project scenario from the previous question, the project team completes the designs (Task A) and then begins construction (Task B). What type of dependency describes the relationship between Tasks A and B?

- Start-to-Start (SS)


- Start-to-Finish (SF)


- **Finish-to-Start (FS)**

> Task A must be completed before Task B can start (the designs must be completed before construction can begin), making this an example of a Finish-to-Start dependency.


- Finish-to-Finish (FF)
